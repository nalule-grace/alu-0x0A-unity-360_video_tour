Unity 360 Video Tour


Project Overview


This project marks the beginning of your journey into creating Virtual Reality (VR) experiences. Through this project, you’ll explore the fundamentals of VR, including positional tracking, degrees of freedom (DOF), and 360-degree video interaction. You will use Unity as the primary development platform and test your projects using available VR headsets like Oculus Go, Google Cardboard, or others.

Getting Started
To start working on this project, you’ll need the following:

VR Headset:
Oculus Go (available at the Holberton San Francisco location)
Google Cardboard (an inexpensive alternative)
Other headsets such as HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, or Oculus Rift.
Depending on your hardware, you'll need to consider:

The appropriate SDK for your headset.
Controls and navigation schemes specific to your hardware.
Hardware capabilities such as degrees of freedom (DOF) and positional tracking.
Note: If you're developing for Android or iOS devices, uploading your application to the App Store or Play Store is not required.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

Explain the difference between 3DOF (Three Degrees of Freedom) and 6DOF (Six Degrees of Freedom).
Identify the various VR headsets on the market and how to develop experiences targeting them.
Understand 360-degree video and its potential use cases.
Differentiate between monoscopic and stereoscopic 360 video.
Work with render textures and utilize Unity’s Video Player component.
Understand and mitigate motion sickness in VR.
Apply best practices in VR UX design.
Key Concepts
Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
3DOF: Allows rotational movement (yaw, pitch, roll) but no positional tracking.
6DOF: Allows both rotational and positional tracking, enabling users to physically move through space in VR.
360-Degree Video
Monoscopic: A single 360-degree video that lacks depth perception.
Stereoscopic: Provides depth perception by using two slightly different images for each eye, mimicking binocular vision.
